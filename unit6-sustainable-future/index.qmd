# Unit 6: Building a Sustainable Future {.unnumbered}

## Anchor Phenomenon

> **Every year, millions of people die prematurely from environmental causes linked to human activities. What is causing these deaths — and what solutions can reduce them?**

## Unit Driving Question

> **How can we reduce the negative impacts of human activities on the environment while still meeting our needs?**

## Unit Overview

In this unit, you investigate how three major human activities — burning fossil fuels, changing land use, and mining — affect environmental health and contribute to premature deaths worldwide. You'll analyze real health and environmental data, build computational models to test solutions, and evaluate trade-offs between economic needs and environmental protection. By the end, you'll design and defend a multi-solution proposal using the Claim–Evidence–Reasoning (CER) framework.

## Performance Expectations

| Standard | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **HS-ESS3-2** | Evaluate competing design solutions for developing, managing, and utilizing energy and mineral resources based on cost-benefit ratios |
| **HS-ETS1-2** | Design a solution to a complex real-world problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable problems that can be solved through engineering |

## Lesson Sequences

| Chapter | Topic | Days | Standards |
|---------|-------|------|-----------|
| **Opening** | Anchor phenomenon, global health data, connections between activities and impacts | 1 | — |
| **Burning Fossil Fuels 5E** | Air pollution, regional health disparities, carbon cycle disruption, energy solutions | 7–9 | HS-ESS3-2 |
| **Land Use & Biodiversity 5E** | Urban heat islands, land cover change, ecosystem tipping points, cooling solutions | 7–9 | HS-ESS3-2 |
| **Mining 5E** | Mining health impacts, contamination pathways, ecological destruction, competing solutions | 7–9 | HS-ESS3-2 |
| **Closing** | Performance task: design and defend a multi-solution proposal | 3 | HS-ESS3-2, HS-ETS1-2 |

## What You'll Figure Out

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:

- 🏭 **Trace** how fossil fuel combustion products travel through the environment to cause disease
- 🌳 **Model** how land use changes create urban heat islands and push ecosystems toward tipping points
- ⛏️ **Explain** how mining contaminants reach communities through air and water pathways
- 📊 **Analyze** health data to identify patterns of environmental injustice
- 🔬 **Use computational models** to test and compare solutions
- ⚖️ **Evaluate** solutions using multiple criteria: cost, safety, and reliability
- 📢 **Construct** an evidence-based argument for a multi-solution sustainability proposal
