## 3.1 Investigative Phenomenon: Patterns in Earth's Past

### The Mystery of Glacial Cycles

Earth's climate has not been stable throughout human history. Our planet has experienced dramatic swings between ice ages (glacial periods) and warmer periods (interglacial periods). Understanding what caused these past climate changes is essential for determining whether today's warming is natural or caused by human activities.

### Engage: Observing the Data

Examine the graph below, which shows two important pieces of data over the past 350,000 years:

1. **Temperature changes** compared to today (shown in the lower graph)
2. **July insolation at 65°N** - the amount of solar radiation reaching Earth at this latitude during summer (shown in the upper graph)

\begin{figure}
\centering
\caption{Radiation and temperature patterns over 350,000 years. The upper graph shows July insolation (solar radiation) at 65°N latitude. The lower graph shows global temperature variations compared to present day, with glacial and interglacial periods marked.}
\label{fig:radiation-temp}
\end{figure}

**Note:** Insolation refers to incoming solar radiation - the amount of energy from the Sun that reaches Earth's surface.

**Interactive Element:** Explore the data yourself using this interactive graph: [NOAA Paleoclimatology Vostok Ice Core Data Visualization](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/study/2453)

### See-Think-Wonder Analysis

Complete this analysis to help you notice important patterns in the data:

**What do you SEE?**

Look carefully at both graphs. Record your observations:

\begin{itemize}
\item What pattern do you observe in the frequency of interglacial and glacial periods?
\item What pattern do you observe in the July insolation graph?
\item How do the two graphs relate to each other?
\item What is the approximate time span between major temperature peaks?
\end{itemize}

**What do you THINK?**

Based on your observations, consider:

\begin{itemize}
\item What might be causing these interglacial and glacial periods?
\item What factors do you think influence the amount of insolation reaching Earth at 65°N in July?
\item Why might scientists have chosen to measure insolation at 65°N specifically?
\item Is there a relationship between insolation and temperature? What evidence supports this?
\end{itemize}

**What do you WONDER?**

Generate questions about what you've observed:

\begin{itemize}
\item What could cause the amount of solar radiation reaching Earth to change over time?
\item Why do the temperature changes seem to follow a regular pattern?
\item Could these same factors be causing climate change today?
\item What made Earth transition from glacial to interglacial periods?
\end{itemize}

### Initial Ideas

Before investigating further, what is your initial hypothesis about what causes these long-term climate cycles? Consider factors related to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Earth's position relative to the Sun
\item Changes in the Sun itself
\item Changes in Earth's atmosphere
\item Other factors?
\end{itemize}

## 3.2 Milankovitch Cycles: Earth's Orbital Variations

### Introduction to Orbital Factors

In the 1920s, Serbian scientist Milutin Milanković proposed that long-term changes in Earth's orbit and axial tilt could explain the glacial-interglacial cycles[1]. These variations, now called Milankovitch cycles, affect how much solar radiation reaches different parts of Earth at different times of year.

There are three main orbital factors that change over time:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Eccentricity} - The shape of Earth's orbit around the Sun
\item \textbf{Obliquity (Tilt)} - The angle of Earth's rotational axis
\item \textbf{Precession} - The direction Earth's axis points in space
\end{enumerate}

### 3.2.1 Eccentricity: The Shape of Earth's Orbit

**What is it?**

Eccentricity describes how circular or elliptical (oval-shaped) Earth's orbit is. When eccentricity is low, Earth's orbit is nearly circular. When eccentricity is high, the orbit is more elliptical, meaning Earth gets closer to and farther from the Sun during its yearly revolution.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\caption{Earth's orbital eccentricity varies between nearly circular (low eccentricity) and more elliptical (high eccentricity) over approximately 100,000-year cycles.}
\label{fig:eccentricity}
\end{figure}

**Interactive Visualization:** Manipulate Earth's orbital eccentricity and observe how it changes Earth's distance from the Sun: [Earth's Orbit Simulator - University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://astro.unl.edu/classaction/animations/coordsmotion/ecliptic.html)

**Cycle length:** Approximately 100,000 years (with variations around 95,000-125,000 years)

**How does it affect climate?**

\begin{itemize}
\item When Earth's orbit is more elliptical, there is a greater difference between the closest approach (perihelion) and farthest distance (aphelion) from the Sun
\item This affects the total amount of solar radiation Earth receives throughout the year
\item The effect is relatively small compared to other orbital factors (only about 0.2\% variation in solar energy)
\end{itemize}

**Current status:** Earth's orbit is currently nearly circular (low eccentricity) and becoming more circular over the next 50,000 years.

### 3.2.2 Obliquity: Earth's Axial Tilt

**What is it?**

Obliquity is the angle between Earth's rotational axis and a line perpendicular to its orbital plane. You learned in Chapter 2 that this tilt is what causes seasons. However, the amount of tilt changes over time.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\caption{Earth's axial tilt (obliquity) varies between 22.1° and 24.5° over approximately 41,000-year cycles. Current tilt is 23.4° and decreasing.}
\label{fig:obliquity}
\end{figure>

**Interactive Demo:** Adjust Earth's axial tilt and observe how it affects seasonal sunlight distribution: [Seasons Interactive - University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://astro.unl.edu/classaction/animations/coordsmotion/obliquity.html)

**Cycle length:** Approximately 41,000 years

**How does it affect climate?**

\begin{itemize}
\item Greater tilt means more extreme seasons - hotter summers and colder winters, especially at high latitudes
\item Lesser tilt means milder seasons - cooler summers and warmer winters
\item Cool summers are critical for ice sheet growth because snow that falls in winter doesn't fully melt in summer
\item High-latitude summer temperatures are the key factor determining whether ice sheets grow or shrink
\end{itemize}

**Current status:** Earth's tilt is currently 23.4° and decreasing (moving toward less extreme seasons).

### 3.2.3 Precession: The Direction of Earth's Tilt

**What is it?**

Precession refers to the slow "wobble" of Earth's axis, similar to how a spinning top wobbles. This changes which direction Earth's North Pole points in space. Currently, Earth's axis points toward Polaris (the North Star), but 13,000 years ago it pointed toward the star Vega.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\caption{Earth's axis precesses (wobbles) over approximately 26,000-year cycles, changing the direction the North Pole points in space and altering when perihelion and aphelion occur during the year.}
\label{fig:precession}
\end{figure}

**Cycle length:** Approximately 26,000 years (combined with orbital precession creates a 21,000-year cycle)

**How does it affect climate?**

Precession determines the timing of when Earth is closest to and farthest from the Sun relative to the seasons:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Currently:} Northern Hemisphere summer occurs when Earth is farthest from the Sun (aphelion), making summers slightly cooler
\item \textbf{~11,000 years ago:} Northern Hemisphere summer occurred when Earth was closest to the Sun (perihelion), making summers warmer
\item This affects how intense the seasons are in each hemisphere
\item Warmer summers at high northern latitudes can melt more ice, preventing ice sheet growth
\end{itemize}

**Current status:** Northern Hemisphere is currently tilted away from the Sun during perihelion (closest approach), resulting in relatively cool summers.

### Combining the Three Factors

The three Milankovitch cycles operate simultaneously and combine to influence climate:

\begin{itemize}
\item The 100,000-year eccentricity cycle appears to pace the major glacial-interglacial transitions
\item The 41,000-year tilt cycle and 21,000-year precession cycle create shorter-term variations
\item When these cycles align to produce cool northern hemisphere summers, ice sheets can grow, leading to glacial periods
\item When they align to produce warm northern hemisphere summers, ice sheets melt, leading to interglacial periods
\end{itemize}

**Key Concept:** High-latitude summer insolation is the critical factor. Cool summers allow snow and ice to persist year-round, enabling ice sheets to grow. Warm summers cause melting that prevents or reverses ice sheet growth.

## 3.3 Investigation: Modeling Orbital Factors

### Purpose

In this investigation, you will use physical models to determine how each orbital factor affects the amount and distribution of solar radiation reaching Earth's surface. This will help you evaluate whether these factors can explain the glacial-interglacial cycles you observed in the data.

### Materials

\begin{itemize}
\item Small flashlight (representing the Sun)
\item Sphere or globe (representing Earth)
\item Markers or tape
\item Ruler or measuring tape
\item Dark room or dimmed lighting
\end{itemize}

### Safety Considerations

Avoid shining the flashlight directly into anyone's eyes. Work in a controlled manner to prevent dropping equipment.

### Investigation Part A: Direction of Earth's Tilt (Precession)

**Question:** How does the direction of Earth's tilt affect the amount of radiation reaching 65°N in summer?

**Setup:**

\begin{enumerate}
\item Mark the North Pole (90°N), 65°N latitude, equator (0°), and 45°S on your sphere
\item Position your flashlight to represent the Sun at a fixed distance from the sphere
\item Tilt your sphere at 23.5° to represent Earth's current tilt
\end{enumerate}

**Procedure:**

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Northern Hemisphere tilted TOWARD the Sun:} Position the sphere so the North Pole tilts toward the flashlight. This represents Northern Hemisphere summer when perihelion occurs (Earth closest to Sun). Observe the intensity and spread of light at 65°N.
\item \textbf{Northern Hemisphere tilted AWAY from the Sun:} Position the sphere so the North Pole tilts away from the flashlight. This represents Northern Hemisphere summer when aphelion occurs (Earth farthest from Sun). Observe the intensity and spread of light at 65°N.
\end{enumerate}

**Record your observations:**

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{10cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Scenario} & \textbf{Observations at 65°N} \\
\hline
NH summer at perihelion & \\
(North Pole toward Sun) & \\
\hline
NH summer at aphelion & \\
(North Pole toward Sun, & \\
but Earth farther away) & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Observations of light intensity at 65°N during different precession scenarios}
\end{table}

**Analysis Questions:**

\begin{enumerate}
\item Does the total amount of radiation reaching Earth change significantly? Why or why not?
\item Does the amount of radiation reaching 65°N in summer change? Provide evidence.
\item Would this change be enough to affect ice sheet growth or melting? Explain your reasoning.
\end{enumerate}

### Investigation Part B: Degree of Earth's Tilt (Obliquity)

**Question:** How does the angle of Earth's tilt affect the amount of radiation reaching 65°N in summer?

**Procedure:**

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Minimum tilt (22.1°):} Position the sphere with a smaller tilt toward the flashlight during Northern Hemisphere summer. Observe the intensity and spread of light at 65°N.
\item \textbf{Maximum tilt (24.5°):} Position the sphere with a greater tilt toward the flashlight during Northern Hemisphere summer. Observe the intensity and spread of light at 65°N.
\end{enumerate}

**Record your observations:**

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{10cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Scenario} & \textbf{Observations at 65°N} \\
\hline
Minimum tilt (22.1°) & \\
\hline
Maximum tilt (24.5°) & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Observations of light intensity at 65°N during different obliquity scenarios}
\end{table}

**Analysis Questions:**

\begin{enumerate}
\item How does changing the tilt angle affect the intensity of light at 65°N during summer?
\item Which tilt angle (minimum or maximum) would produce warmer summers at 65°N?
\item Which tilt scenario would be more likely to cause ice sheets to melt? Explain.
\item Does changing the tilt affect the total amount of radiation Earth receives? Explain.
\end{enumerate}

### Investigation Part C: Shape of Earth's Orbit (Eccentricity)

**Question:** How does Earth's distance from the Sun affect the amount of radiation reaching Earth's surface?

**Procedure:**

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Minimum eccentricity (circular orbit):} Hold the flashlight at a consistent distance (e.g., 15 cm) from all points of the sphere as you rotate it. Observe the light intensity.
\item \textbf{Maximum eccentricity (elliptical orbit):} Vary the flashlight distance from 12 cm (perihelion) to 18 cm (aphelion) as you rotate the sphere. Observe how the light intensity changes at different distances.
\end{enumerate}

**Record your observations:**

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{10cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Scenario} & \textbf{Observations} \\
\hline
Low eccentricity & \\
(circular orbit) & \\
\hline
High eccentricity & \\
(elliptical orbit) & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Observations of light intensity during different eccentricity scenarios}
\end{table}

**Analysis Questions:**

\begin{enumerate}
\item How does distance from the Sun affect the intensity of radiation reaching Earth?
\item When eccentricity is high, which position (perihelion or aphelion) receives more radiation?
\item Does eccentricity change where on Earth receives the most intense radiation, or just the total amount?
\item How might high eccentricity interact with precession to affect climate?
\end{enumerate}

### Investigation Summary

Based on your physical models, answer these synthesis questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Which orbital factor(s) most directly affect the intensity of summer radiation at high northern latitudes?
\item Which orbital factor(s) affect the total amount of radiation Earth receives from the Sun?
\item Do you think Earth's orbital variations could explain the glacial-interglacial cycles observed in the temperature data? Why or why not?
\end{enumerate}

## 3.4 Analyzing Past Climate Transitions

### Connecting Models to Real Data

Now that you understand how each orbital factor works, you'll analyze real data about Earth's orbital parameters during specific climate transitions in the past. This will allow you to test whether Milankovitch cycles can actually explain the glacial-interglacial pattern.

### Transition 1: 144,000 to 130,000 Years Ago (Glacial to Interglacial)

This transition represents Earth emerging from a glacial period into a warm interglacial period.

**Orbital data:**

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Orbital Factor} & \textbf{144,000 ya} & \textbf{130,000 ya} \\
\hline
Eccentricity & & \\
~ Min distance & 145.6 million km & 143.8 million km \\
~ Max distance & 153.6 million km & 155.4 million km \\
\hline
Tilt & 22.6° & 24.25° \\
\hline
Precession & NH toward Sun & NH toward Sun \\
~ (at perihelion) & when closer & when closer \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Orbital parameters during the transition from glacial to interglacial conditions 144-130 kya}
\end{table}

**Analysis:**

Complete this table to determine the effect of each factor:

\begin{table}

Precession & & \\
\hline
Eccentricity & & \\
\hline
Tilt & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Analysis of orbital factor changes and their climate effects}
\end{table}

**Questions:**

\begin{enumerate}
\item Based on the changes in orbital factors, would you predict Northern Hemisphere summers at 65°N to become warmer or cooler between 144 kya and 130 kya?
\item How would this change affect ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere?
\item Does your prediction match what actually happened according to the temperature graph? (Look back at Figure 3.1)
\end{enumerate}

### Transition 2: 130,000 to 113,000 Years Ago (Interglacial to Glacial)

This transition represents Earth transitioning from the warm interglacial period back into a glacial period.

**Orbital data:**

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Orbital Factor} & \textbf{130,000 ya} & \textbf{113,000 ya} \\
\hline
Eccentricity & & \\
~ Min distance & 143.8 million km & 143.6 million km \\
~ Max distance & 155.4 million km & 155.6 million km \\
\hline
Tilt & 24.25° & 22.25° \\
\hline

~ (at perihelion) & when closer & when closer \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Orbital parameters during the transition from interglacial to glacial conditions 130-113 kya}
\end{table>

**Analysis:**

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{8cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Factor} & \textbf{Changed?} & \textbf{Effect on summer radiation at 65°N} \\
\hline
Precession & & \\
\hline
Eccentricity & & \\
\hline
Tilt & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Analysis of orbital factor changes and their climate effects}
\end{table>

**Questions:**

\begin{enumerate}
\item Based on the changes in orbital factors, would you predict Northern Hemisphere summers at 65°N to become warmer or cooler between 130 kya and 113 kya?
\item How would this change affect ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere?
\item Does your prediction match what actually happened according to the temperature graph?
\item Which orbital factor(s) changed most significantly during this transition?
\end{enumerate}

### Transition 3: 25,000 to 9,000 Years Ago (Last Glacial Maximum to Holocene)

This is the most recent major climate transition, when Earth emerged from the last ice age into our current warm interglacial period (called the Holocene).

**Orbital data:**

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Orbital Factor} & \textbf{25,000 ya} & \textbf{9,000 ya} \\
\hline
Eccentricity & & \\
~ Min distance & 147.36 million km & 146.61 million km \\
~ Max distance & 151.84 million km & 152.59 million km \\
\hline
Tilt & 22.3° & 24.25° \\
\hline
Precession & NH away from Sun & NH away from Sun \\
~ (at perihelion) & when closer & when closer \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Orbital parameters during the transition from the Last Glacial Maximum to the Holocene interglacial}
\end{table>

**Analysis:**

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|p{8cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Factor} & \textbf{Changed?} & \textbf{Effect on summer radiation at 65°N} \\
\hline
Precession & & \\
\hline
Eccentricity & & \\
\hline
Tilt & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Analysis of orbital factor changes and their climate effects}
\end{table}

**Questions:**

\begin{enumerate}
\item Which orbital factor changed most dramatically during this transition?
\item Based on the orbital changes, would you predict warmer or cooler summers at 65°N?
\item This transition saw massive ice sheets covering Canada and northern Europe melt completely. Do the orbital factors support this observation?
\item Compare the tilt values. How does the change in tilt from 22.3° to 24.25° affect seasonal contrast?
\end{enumerate}

### Synthesis: The Milankovitch Theory

After analyzing these three major climate transitions, you should be able to see a pattern:

\begin{itemize}
\item Glacial-to-interglacial transitions coincide with orbital configurations that increase summer radiation at high northern latitudes
\item Interglacial-to-glacial transitions coincide with orbital configurations that decrease summer radiation at high northern latitudes
\item The degree of tilt (obliquity) and precession have the strongest effects on high-latitude insolation
\item The 100,000-year eccentricity cycle appears to pace the major glacial-interglacial cycles
\end{itemize}

**Key Insight:** Ice sheets grow when high-latitude summers are cool (snow doesn't melt), and they shrink when high-latitude summers are warm (snow and ice melt). Milankovitch cycles change the intensity of high-latitude summers, thereby controlling ice sheet growth and retreat.

## 3.5 Computational Model: Testing the Full Milankovitch Theory

### Using the Vostok Ice Core Interactive

While your physical models and analysis of specific transitions provide strong evidence for the Milankovitch theory, you can test this theory more rigorously using a computational model that shows all 400,000 years of data.

**Access the interactive model:** [The Vostok Core and Milankovitch Cycles Interactive](https://www.sciencecourseware.org/eec/GlobalWarming/Modules/Milankovitch/)

The Vostok ice core was drilled in Antarctica by Russian and American scientists, reaching a depth of 3,623 meters. Air bubbles trapped in the ice preserve ancient atmospheric gases, allowing scientists to reconstruct temperature changes over 400,000 years.

**How to Use the Interactive:**

\begin{enumerate}
\item Click different views (Top View, Oblique View) to see Earth's orbit from different perspectives
\item Toggle checkboxes for Eccentricity, Tilt, and Precession to overlay their effects on the temperature graph
\item Use the timeline slider to move through 400,000 years of climate history
\item Observe how the purple line (orbital factors) correlates with the black line (temperature)
\end{enumerate}

### Familiarization Questions

Before analyzing the data, explore the model to understand its features:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Click "Top View" to see Earth's orbit from above. At which point in Earth's orbit does the summer solstice occur? Is this perihelion (closest) or aphelion (farthest) from the Sun currently?
\item Click "Oblique View" to see Earth's axial tilt. During Northern Hemisphere summer, which direction is the North Pole tilted? Toward or away from the Sun?
\item Examine the Vostok temperature graph on the right. In the past 400,000 years, how many complete glacial-interglacial cycles do you observe?
\item Are present-day temperatures the warmest in the past 400,000 years? Provide evidence.
\end{enumerate}

### Testing Individual Factors

Now you'll test whether each orbital factor correlates with (matches) the temperature pattern.

**Eccentricity Test:**

\begin{enumerate}
\item Click the "Eccentricity" box at the bottom of the screen. A purple line will appear on the temperature graph showing how eccentricity has varied.
\item Compare the purple line (eccentricity) to the temperature line.
\end{enumerate}

**Question:** Does eccentricity alone closely match the temperature pattern? Support your answer with specific evidence from the graph (cite time periods where they match or don't match).

**Precession Test:**

\begin{enumerate}
\item Uncheck "Eccentricity" and click "Precession." A new purple line will appear.
\item Compare the purple line (precession) to the temperature line.
\end{enumerate}

**Question:** Does precession alone closely match the temperature pattern? Support your answer with evidence.

**Obliquity (Tilt) Test:**

\begin{enumerate}
\item Uncheck "Precession" and click "Tilt." A new purple line will appear.
\item Compare the purple line (tilt) to the temperature line.
\end{enumerate}

**Question:** Does obliquity alone closely match the temperature pattern? Which factor so far shows the strongest correlation?

### Testing Combined Factors

\begin{enumerate}
\item Click all three boxes: "Eccentricity," "Precession," and "Tilt." The purple line now shows the combined effect of all three Milankovitch cycles on summer insolation at 65°N.
\item Carefully examine how well the purple line matches the temperature variations over all 400,000 years.
\end{enumerate}

**Analysis Questions:**

\begin{enumerate}
\item Does the combined effect of all three orbital factors correlate more closely with temperature than any single factor alone?
\item Identify a specific time period (give approximate dates) where the orbital factors and temperature match very well. Describe what you observe.
\item Identify a time period where the orbital factors and temperature don't match as well. What might explain this discrepancy? (Consider: might other factors also influence climate?)
\item Overall, do you think the evidence supports the Milankovitch theory that orbital variations cause glacial-interglacial cycles? Explain your reasoning using evidence from the model.
\end{enumerate}

### From Correlation to Causation

You've observed a strong correlation (matching pattern) between Milankovitch cycles and temperature. But correlation doesn't always mean causation. To establish a causal link, you need:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Mechanism:} A physical explanation for how one factor causes the other
\item \textbf{Timing:} The cause should precede the effect
\item \textbf{Consistency:} The relationship should hold across multiple examples
\end{enumerate}

**Reflection Questions:**

\begin{enumerate}
\item Mechanism: Based on your investigations, explain the physical mechanism by which orbital variations cause temperature changes. (Hint: trace the path from orbital configuration → insolation → ice sheets → global temperature)
\item Timing: Do changes in orbital parameters occur before temperature changes, or after? What does the model suggest?
\item Consistency: Did the orbital-temperature relationship hold for all three transitions you analyzed in detail?
\item Conclusion: Do you think you've established a causal link between Milankovitch cycles and glacial-interglacial cycles? Why or why not?
\end{enumerate}

## 3.6 Solar Cycles: Does the Sun's Output Change?

### A New Question

The Milankovitch theory explains climate changes based on how Earth's position affects the distribution of solar radiation across the planet. But what if the Sun itself changes—what if it produces more or less energy over time? Could variations in the Sun's energy output also contribute to climate change?

### Understanding Solar Cycles

The Sun is not a perfectly constant star. Its energy output varies slightly over time, driven by changes in solar magnetic activity. The most visible evidence of this is **sunspots**—dark regions on the Sun's surface that indicate strong magnetic activity.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\caption{Sunspot activity from 2002 (solar maximum) to 2010 (solar minimum), showing changes in the number of sunspots and corresponding ultraviolet radiation output. Brighter images indicate more solar radiation.}
\label{fig:sunspots}
\end{figure}

**Interactive Data Explorer:** Explore current and historical sunspot activity with real NASA data: [NOAA Solar Cycle Progression](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/solar-cycle-progression)

**Real-Time Solar Activity:** View the Sun right now with live satellite imagery: [NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory](https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/)

**Key observations:**

\begin{itemize}
\item More sunspots = higher solar radiation output
\item Fewer sunspots = lower solar radiation output
\item The Sun goes through regular cycles of high and low activity
\end{itemize}

### Analysis Activity: Sunspots and Temperature

Examine the graph showing sunspot activity and global temperature over the past 10,000 years.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\caption{Sunspot activity (proxy for solar radiation) and global temperature variations over the past 10,000 years.}
\label{fig:solar-temp}
\end{figure}

**Questions:**

\begin{enumerate}
\item During periods when sunspot activity increases, what generally happens to global temperature?
\item Are sunspot activity and temperature always correlated? Identify a time period where they don't match well.
\item What might explain times when solar activity is increasing but temperature is decreasing? Can you think of other factors that might influence temperature?
\end{enumerate}

### The Solar Cycle Timescale

Examine the detailed graph of solar cycles over recent centuries:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\caption{Solar cycles showing the number of sunspots over approximately 400 years. Each cycle represents a period from solar minimum to solar maximum and back.}
\label{fig:solar-cycles}
\end{figure}

**Analysis Questions:**

\begin{enumerate}
\item Approximately how long is one complete solar cycle (from minimum to minimum)?
\item Look back at the glacial-interglacial cycle graph in Section 3.1. Approximately how long are those cycles?
\item Do the timescales of solar cycles match the timescales of glacial-interglacial cycles?
\item Based on the difference in timescales, do you think solar cycles could be the primary cause of glacial-interglacial cycling? Explain your reasoning.
\end{enumerate}

### Key Findings About Solar Cycles

Based on your analysis:

\begin{itemize}
\item Solar cycles last approximately **11 years**
\item Glacial-interglacial cycles last approximately **100,000 years**
\item The timescales don't match—solar cycles are far too short to explain ice age cycles
\item Solar radiation does vary slightly, and this can influence climate on short timescales (decades to centuries)
\item However, solar variations cannot explain the major glacial-interglacial transitions
\end{itemize}

**Conclusion:** While the Sun's output does vary over time, these variations operate on a much shorter timescale than the major climate changes of the past 400,000 years. Milankovitch cycles, not solar cycles, provide the best explanation for glacial-interglacial cycling.

## 3.7 Performance Task: Orbital Factors and Today's Climate

### The Critical Question

You've established that Milankovitch cycles caused major climate changes in the past. Now you must address the most important question for understanding today's climate:

**Are orbital factors responsible for current global warming?**

### Current Orbital Configuration

Examine the data comparing Earth's orbital parameters from 9,000 years ago (early Holocene) to today:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Orbital Factor} & \textbf{9,000 ya} & \textbf{Today (0 ya)} \\
\hline
Eccentricity & & \\
~ Minimum distance & 146.61 million km & 147.06 million km \\
~ Maximum distance & 152.59 million km & 152.14 million km \\
\hline
Tilt & 24.25° & 23.4° \\
\hline
Precession & NH away from Sun & NH away from Sun \\
~ (at perihelion) & when closer & when closer \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Orbital parameters from 9,000 years ago to present}
\end{table}

### Historical Temperature Context

Review the temperature graph showing the past 10,000 years:

**Interactive Temperature Timeline:** Explore global temperature changes over different timescales with this interactive tool: [NOAA Climate.gov Global Temperature Time Series](https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/dataset/global-temperature-anomalies-graphing-tool)

**Compare Past and Present:** Use this interactive to compare current warming to past climate events: [IPCC Temperature Change Interactive Atlas](https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch/)

**Key observations:**

\begin{itemize}
\item From 9,000 to ~200 years ago: gradual cooling trend
\item From ~200 years ago to present: rapid warming
\item Rate of recent warming: approximately 1.25°C in 200 years
\end{itemize}

### Performance Task Analysis

Use the data above to answer these questions for your unit performance task:

**Part 1: Expected Climate Trend**

\begin{enumerate}
\item How has Earth's tilt changed from 9,000 years ago to today? (Increased or decreased?)
\item How has eccentricity changed?
\item Based on these orbital changes, what would you predict should be happening to summer temperatures at high northern latitudes over the past 9,000 years?
\item What should be happening to ice sheets based on the orbital factors?
\item Does your prediction match the actual temperature trend from 9,000 to 200 years ago?
\end{enumerate}

**Part 2: The Recent Reversal**

\begin{enumerate}
\item According to the orbital data, should the cooling trend be continuing today, or should temperatures be rising?
\item What is actually happening to global temperatures over the past 200 years?
\item Calculate the rate of recent warming: How many years did it take for temperatures to rise 1.25°C in the recent period?
\item Compare this to the previous fastest warming event in the data (coming out of the last glacial maximum ~15,000-10,000 years ago). How long did it take temperatures to rise 1.25°C during that event?
\item What is significantly different about the current warming compared to past natural warming events?
\end{enumerate}

**Part 3: Evaluating Claims**

A climate skeptic claims: "Climate has always changed naturally due to Earth's orbital variations. Today's warming is just part of natural cycles."

Using evidence from this chapter:

\begin{enumerate}
\item What part of this claim is correct? (What does orbital variation actually cause?)
\item What part of this claim is incorrect or misleading when applied to today's climate?
\item Write a response to this skeptic using data about current orbital parameters, expected climate trends, and observed climate trends. Your response should explain why orbital factors cannot account for current warming.
\end{enumerate}

### Synthesis Statement

Complete this statement based on your analysis:

"Based on Earth's current orbital configuration (decreasing tilt, low eccentricity, and Northern Hemisphere summer occurring at aphelion), Milankovitch theory predicts that Earth should be experiencing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ [cooling/warming]. The fact that Earth is actually experiencing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ [cooling/warming] at a rate of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ °C per century indicates that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_."

## 3.8 Chapter Summary

### Key Concepts

\begin{itemize}
\item Earth has experienced regular glacial-interglacial cycles over the past 400,000+ years, with ice ages occurring approximately every 100,000 years
\item Milankovitch cycles—variations in Earth's orbital eccentricity (100,000-year cycle), axial tilt (41,000-year cycle), and precession (21,000-year cycle)—change the amount and distribution of solar radiation reaching Earth's surface
\item High-latitude summer insolation is the critical factor controlling ice sheet growth and retreat: cool summers allow ice sheets to grow, warm summers cause them to melt
\item Physical and computational models demonstrate a strong correlation between Milankovitch cycles and glacial-interglacial temperature changes
\item A causal mechanism exists: orbital configuration → changes in insolation → changes in ice sheet extent → changes in global temperature
\item Solar output varies on an 11-year cycle but cannot explain long-term glacial-interglacial cycles due to timescale mismatch
\item Current orbital parameters predict Earth should be cooling gradually, yet temperatures have risen rapidly over the past 200 years, indicating that factors other than orbital variations must be driving current climate change
\end{itemize}

### Three-Dimensional Learning

**Science and Engineering Practices:**

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Developing and Using Models:} You used physical models to investigate how orbital factors affect insolation and computational models to test the Milankovitch theory against real data
\item \textbf{Analyzing and Interpreting Data:} You analyzed temperature and insolation data spanning 400,000 years, identifying patterns and relationships
\item \textbf{Constructing Explanations:} You developed mechanistic explanations for how orbital variations cause climate changes
\end{itemize}

**Crosscutting Concepts:**

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Patterns:} Recognizing cyclical patterns in temperature data and orbital parameters
\item \textbf{Cause and Effect:} Establishing causal relationships between orbital variations and climate change through mechanism, timing, and consistency
\item \textbf{Stability and Change:} Understanding that climate systems have natural variability but can be disrupted by factors operating outside normal ranges
\item \textbf{Scale, Proportion, and Quantity:} Comparing timescales of different climate forcing factors (11-year solar cycles vs. 100,000-year ice age cycles vs. 200-year industrial warming)
\end{itemize}

**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{ESS1.B Earth and the Solar System:} Cyclical changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect climate over tens to hundreds of thousands of years
\item \textbf{ESS2.A Earth Materials and Systems:} Ice sheets respond to changes in energy input, creating major changes in Earth systems
\item \textbf{ESS2.D Weather and Climate:} Climate varies naturally on multiple timescales due to different forcing mechanisms
\end{itemize}

### Driving Question Answered

**What factors have contributed to climate change in the past and are they contributing to climate change now?**

Milankovitch cycles (changes in Earth's orbit and axial tilt) have been the primary driver of major climate changes over the past several hundred thousand years, causing glacial-interglacial cycles through changes in high-latitude summer insolation. However, current orbital parameters predict gradual cooling, not the rapid warming observed over the past 200 years. This discrepancy indicates that orbital factors are NOT responsible for current climate change—other factors must be at play. In the next chapter, you'll investigate what those factors might be.

### Looking Ahead

You've ruled out natural orbital variations as the cause of recent warming. You've also seen that solar output variations operate on too short a timescale. This leads to a critical question for the next chapter:

**If natural factors can't explain current warming, what can?**

In Chapter 4, you'll investigate the role of greenhouse gases, feedback mechanisms, and human activities in driving rapid climate change.
