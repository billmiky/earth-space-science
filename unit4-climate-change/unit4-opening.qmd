# Anchor Phenomenon

::: {.anchor-box}
## 🌍 Earth's Temperature Is Rising

**Earth's temperature is rising, reversing the cooling trend that occurred over the past 2,000 years, putting millions of people in harm's way, yet the public is not convinced of the risks.**

### Essential Questions:
- How do natural factors contribute to changes in Earth's temperature?
- What are 99.9% of climate scientists seeing in historical climate data that makes them so sure humans are the cause of climate change today?
- Why does it matter?

# The Reality of Climate Change

## Global Temperature Trends

Let's examine how Earth's temperature has changed over time using real data.

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
// Interactive Global Temperature Anomaly Visualization
Plot = require("@observablehq/plot")

// Temperature anomaly data (NASA GISTEMP simplified)
tempData = [
  {year: 1880, anomaly: -0.16}, {year: 1890, anomaly: -0.33},
  {year: 1900, anomaly: -0.08}, {year: 1910, anomaly: -0.42},
  {year: 1920, anomaly: -0.25}, {year: 1930, anomaly: -0.14},
  {year: 1940, anomaly: 0.12}, {year: 1950, anomaly: -0.17},
  {year: 1960, anomaly: -0.01}, {year: 1970, anomaly: -0.01},
  {year: 1980, anomaly: 0.26}, {year: 1990, anomaly: 0.45},
  {year: 2000, anomaly: 0.42}, {year: 2010, anomaly: 0.72},
  {year: 2020, anomaly: 1.02}, {year: 2024, anomaly: 1.29}
]
```

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
viewof yearRange = Inputs.range([1880, 2024], {
  step: 10,
  value: 2024,
  label: "Explore data up to year:"
})
```

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
filteredData = tempData.filter(d => d.year <= yearRange)

Plot.plot({
  title: "Global Temperature Anomaly (°C relative to 1951-1980 average)",
  width: 700,
  height: 400,
  y: {label: "Temperature Anomaly (°C)", domain: [-0.6, 1.5]},
  x: {label: "Year"},
  marks: [
    Plot.ruleY([0], {stroke: "#ccc", strokeDasharray: "4,4"}),
    Plot.line(filteredData, {x: "year", y: "anomaly", stroke: "steelblue", strokeWidth: 2}),
    Plot.dot(filteredData, {x: "year", y: "anomaly", fill: d => d.anomaly > 0 ? "red" : "blue", r: 5}),
    Plot.text(filteredData.slice(-1), {x: "year", y: "anomaly", text: d => `${d.anomaly}°C`, dy: -15, fontSize: 14, fontWeight: "bold"})
  ]
})
```

::: {.check-understanding}
### ✅ Check Your Understanding
1. What pattern do you observe in the temperature data?
2. Around what year did temperatures begin consistently rising above the baseline?
3. How much warmer is Earth today compared to the 1880s?

2. Why are people being displaced by climate factors?
3. Why are scientists sure that humans are causing climate change?
4. Has the climate ever changed before, and if so, how did it impact populations?
5. How will climate change affect people now and in the future?
6. Why are scientists so sure that climate change is a big deal?

# Performance Task Preview

::: {.anchor-box}
## 📋 Your Mission

Throughout this unit, you will analyze and interpret data related to changes in climate in the past in order to:

1. **Understand** how we are so confident humans are the cause of current climate change
2. **Communicate** this information to educate others in your community about the risks
3. **Predict** how climate factors will be affected in the future
4. **Explain** how populations will be impacted

By the end of this unit, you will create a communication piece for someone in your community that explains:
- Why scientists are certain humans are causing climate change
- How climate factors will be affected
- How populations will be impacted

# Initial Ideas Activity

## What natural factors might cause climate change?

```{=html}
<div style="background: #f5f5f5; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0;">
  <h4>Brainstorm: Natural Climate Factors</h4>
  <p>Before we investigate, record your initial ideas about what natural factors could have caused changes in climate in the past:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Changes in the Sun's energy output</li>
    <li>Volcanic eruptions</li>
    <li>Changes in Earth's orbit</li>
    <li>Ocean current changes</li>
    <li>What else?</li>
