# Unit 4: Climate Change {.unnumbered}

## Driving Question

> **How is Earth's climate changing, and what are the consequences?**

## Unit Overview

In this unit, we investigate Earth's climate system, the evidence for climate change, and the interconnected feedbacks that amplify or moderate climate shifts.

## What You'll Learn

- Moon phases, eclipses, tides, and seasonal cycles
- How Earth's systems interact through feedback loops
- Energy flow patterns that drive climate
- The carbon cycle and human impacts

## Phenomenon

Global average temperatures have risen approximately 1.1°C since the pre-industrial era, with accelerating impacts on ice sheets, sea levels, and extreme weather. What's driving these changes?

# Simulated global temperature data

years = list(range(1880, 2026))

acceleration = [0.00005 * (y - 1950)**2 if y > 1950 else 0 for y in years]
noise = np.random.normal(0, 0.1, len(years))
temps = [b + a + n - 0.2 for b, a, n in zip(baseline_trend, acceleration, noise)]

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Year': years,
    'Temperature Anomaly (°C)': temps
})
