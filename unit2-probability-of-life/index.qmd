# Unit 2: Probability of Life Elsewhere {.unnumbered}

## Anchor Phenomenon

> **4.5 billion years passed and 5 mass extinctions occurred before intelligent life evolved on Earth. Does life — or intelligent life — exist somewhere else?**

## Unit Driving Question

> **Does life exist somewhere outside Earth? What about intelligent life? Why haven't we made contact?**

## Unit Overview

So far, we've found no evidence of life anywhere else in the universe. But the universe is unimaginably vast — there are more stars than grains of sand on Earth, and most stars have planets. In this unit, you investigate the conditions that allowed life to evolve on Earth, from the stability of our solar system to the coevolution of life and Earth's atmosphere, and use that understanding to argue whether intelligent life likely exists elsewhere.

## Performance Expectations

| Standard | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **HS-ESS1-2** | Construct an explanation of the Big Bang theory based on astronomical evidence of light spectra, motion of distant galaxies, and composition of matter in the universe |
| **HS-ESS1-4** | Use mathematical or computational representations to predict the motion of orbiting objects in the solar system |
| **HS-ESS1-6** | Apply scientific reasoning and evidence from ancient Earth materials, meteorites, and other planetary surfaces to construct an account of Earth's formation and early history |
| **HS-ESS2-5** | Plan and conduct an investigation of the properties of water and its effects on Earth materials and surface processes |
| **HS-ESS2-7** | Construct an argument based on evidence about the simultaneous coevolution of Earth's systems and life on Earth |

## What You'll Figure Out

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:

- ☄️ **Explain** why Earth has so few craters compared to the Moon and Mars
- 🦠 **Construct** an argument about how life and Earth's systems coevolved over 4 billion years
- 🌌 **Model** the origin of the universe using evidence from light spectra and cosmic expansion
- 🪨 **Predict** asteroid orbits using mathematical representations of gravity
- 🛡️ **Evaluate** solutions for planetary defense against asteroid impacts
- 📢 **Argue** whether intelligent life likely exists elsewhere in the universe
