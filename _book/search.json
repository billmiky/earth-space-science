    "text": "In 1958, Charles Keeling began measuring CO2 at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii.\n\n\n\n\nAt the start of the record, CO2 levels were around 315 parts per million (ppm). This was already higher than the pre-industrial average, but the curve was just beginning its climb.\n\n\n\n\nIf you look closely at the line, you see a zig-zag pattern. This is the “breathing of the Earth.”\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Northern Hemisphere tilts toward the sun (spring/summer), plants bloom and inhale CO2, dropping the levels. In the fall, leaves decay and release it back.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the “breathing” is overwhelmed by a much stronger force.\n\n\n\n\nAs we scroll to the present day, the trend accelerates upward. We have now passed 420 ppm, a level not seen on Earth for millions of years. This vertical ascent is the direct result of burning fossil fuels.",

We can see the direct correlation when we look at global temperature anomalies over the last century.\n\n\n\n\nThis chart shows the global temperature deviation from the 20th-century average.\n\n\n\n\nBetween 1880 and 1940, years were often cooler than average (shown in blue). The climate fluctuated naturally, but remained relatively stable.\n\n\n\n\nBy the 1980s and 1990s, a shift occurs. The blue bars disappear, replaced almost entirely by red. The “greenhouse effect” predicted by physics is now visible in the data.\n\n\n\n\nIn the last 20 years, the warming has intensified.\n\n\n\n\nThe bars are not just red; they are growing taller. This shows that the rate of warming is increasing, driven by the CO2 accumulation we saw in the previous chart.",

This is wind!\nThe greater the pressure difference (the pressure gradient), the faster the wind.\n\n\n\n24.2.2 📝 Explore Activity\nUse the sliders above to investigate:\n\nSet the left region to 310 K and the right to 270 K. What happens to wind speed?\nNow bring them closer together (290 K and 280 K). How does wind speed change?\nWhat temperature combination creates the strongest wind?\nIn your own words, explain why uneven heating causes wind.",
