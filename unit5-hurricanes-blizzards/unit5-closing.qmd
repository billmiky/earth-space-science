# The Performance Task

::: {.performance-task}
## 🎯 Unit Driving Question

<div style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: 700; text-align: center; margin: 20px 0; color: #f39c12;">
Will there be more frequent and more intense severe storms in the future?
</div>

### Your Task

**Construct an oral argument from data analysis** that addresses how severe storms (hurricanes and/or blizzards) may change in frequency, intensity, or path in the future for **your region** (New York City / Northeast US).

Your argument must:

- ✅ Make a clear **claim** about future storm changes
- ✅ Support your claim with at least **three pieces of evidence** from data analyzed in this unit
- ✅ Include **scientific reasoning** that connects your evidence to your claim using the mechanisms you've learned
- ✅ Address at least **one counterargument** or limitation of your claim
- ✅ Be delivered as a **2–3 minute oral presentation** to your class
:::

# Building Your Argument: The CER Framework

Your argument should follow the **Claim–Evidence–Reasoning** (CER) framework.

::: {.cer-box .claim-box}
### 📌 CLAIM

A clear, specific statement that answers the driving question for your region.

**Example format:** "In the future, [specific storm type] in [your region] will likely become [more/less frequent / more/less intense / shift in timing or path] because [brief reason]."

**Strong claim example:** "Hurricanes affecting the Northeast US will likely become stronger and produce more rainfall by 2050, though they may not increase in total number."

**Weak claim:** "Storms will get worse." ← Too vague! What type? In what way? Where?
:::

::: {.cer-box .evidence-box}
### 📊 EVIDENCE

Specific data points, trends, or observations from your investigations in this unit. You need at least **three** pieces of evidence from **at least two different lesson sequences**.

Good evidence is:
- **Specific** (numbers, dates, locations)
- **From reliable sources** (NOAA data, scientific studies, your own data analysis)
- **Relevant** to your claim (directly supports or informs it)
:::

::: {.cer-box .reasoning-box}
### 🧠 REASONING

The scientific explanation that connects your evidence to your claim. This is where you use the **mechanisms** you learned:

- How does the **Clausius-Clapeyron relation** connect warmer temperatures to storm intensity?
- How does **Arctic amplification** affect the jet stream and storm paths?
- How does **sea surface temperature** affect hurricane formation and intensity?
- How do **convection cells** and the **Coriolis effect** determine where storms form and travel?

# Evidence Review: What You've Learned

Let's review the key evidence from each lesson sequence.

::: {.evidence-card .blizzard}
### 🌨️ From Blizzards Sequence

**Available Evidence:**

| Data Point | What It Shows |
|------------|---------------|
| Winter Storm Jonas stats | 27.5" snow in NYC, 60 mph winds, $3B damages |
| Clausius-Clapeyron relation | ~7% more atmospheric moisture per 1°C warming |
| Extreme snowfall trends | More extreme events per decade even as average snowfall decreases |
| Arctic amplification & jet stream | Weakened gradient → wavier jet → cold outbreaks can be more extreme |
| Pressure gradient & wind | Greater temperature/pressure contrasts → stronger winds |
:::

::: {.evidence-card .paths}
### 🗺️ From Storm Paths Sequence

**Available Evidence:**

| Data Point | What It Shows |
|------------|---------------|
| Storm trajectory maps (2018–2020) | Blizzards and hurricanes follow predictable paths |
| Global circulation cells | Hadley, Ferrel, Polar cells driven by uneven heating |
| Westerlies & jet stream | Mid-latitude storms steered SW→NE by prevailing winds |
| Jet stream projections | Warming may shift storm tracks poleward |
| Precipitation by latitude | Rising air zones = wet; sinking air zones = dry |
:::

::: {.evidence-card .hurricane}
### 🌀 From Hurricanes Sequence

**Available Evidence:**

| Data Point | What It Shows |
|------------|---------------|
| SST threshold: 26.5°C | Minimum ocean temperature for hurricane formation |
| Seasonal lag | Ocean peaks ~2 months after solar maximum (high heat capacity) |
| 2005 season: 28 named storms | Record-breaking season with 0.55°C SST anomaly |
| SST trend: +0.65°C anomaly by 2024 | Tropical Atlantic warming steadily |
| Rapid intensification: +150% increase | Storms strengthening faster → less warning time |
| Named storm count trend | Slight upward trend from ~11 (1980) to ~18+ (2020s) |

### 📝 Data Analysis Questions

Before writing your argument, analyze this synthesis graph:

1. Is there a clear correlation between global temperature and the **number** of named storms? Why or why not?
2. Is there a stronger relationship between temperature and the **intensity** of the strongest storms?
3. Why might the relationship between warming and storm **count** be more complicated than the relationship between warming and storm **intensity**?
4. What does this mean for your claim? (Hint: "more storms" vs. "stronger storms" are different claims!)

# Argument Structure Guide

::: {.key-idea}
### 📋 Oral Argument Outline (2–3 minutes)

**Opening (15–20 seconds):**
State your claim clearly and specifically.

**Evidence Block 1 (30–45 seconds):**
Present your first piece of evidence. Explain what the data shows using specific numbers.

**Evidence Block 2 (30–45 seconds):**
Present a second piece of evidence from a *different* lesson sequence. Explain the trend or pattern.

**Evidence Block 3 (20–30 seconds):**
Present a third supporting piece of evidence.

**Reasoning (30–45 seconds):**
Explain the **scientific mechanism** that connects your evidence to your claim. Use key vocabulary.

**Counterargument (15–20 seconds):**
Acknowledge one limitation, uncertainty, or opposing viewpoint. Explain why your claim still holds.

**Closing (10–15 seconds):**
Restate your claim and its significance for your community.

# Addressing Counterarguments

A strong scientific argument acknowledges complexity. Consider these common counterpoints:

| Counterargument | How to Address It |
|----------------|-------------------|
| "Natural variability causes storm cycles, not climate change" | True that multi-decadal cycles exist (AMO), but the long-term warming trend is overlaid on top of natural variability. The mechanisms (more moisture, warmer SST) add fuel regardless of cycle phase. |
| "Some studies show fewer total storms in a warmer world" | Correct — some models project fewer but **more intense** storms. Distinguish between frequency and intensity in your claim. |
| "We can't predict individual storms" | True — but we can project **statistical changes** in average conditions. Like saying "summers will be hotter" without predicting the temperature on July 14, 2047. |
| "Technology and preparation can prevent damage" | Important point, but infrastructure has limits. The **physics** of stronger storms still matters even with better warning systems. |

# Peer Review & Feedback

::: {.student-task}
### 👥 Peer Feedback Protocol

After each oral argument, provide feedback on:

| Criterion | Rating (1–4) | Comments |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Claim** is clear, specific, and answerable | | |
| At least **3 pieces of evidence** from data | | |
| Evidence is **specific** (numbers, dates, sources) | | |
| **Scientific reasoning** connects evidence to claim | | |
| At least **1 counterargument** addressed | | |
| **Vocabulary** used accurately | | |
| **Delivery** is clear and within time limit | | |

# Reflection: How Has Your Thinking Changed?

::: {.reflection-box}
### 🔄 Revisiting Your Hypothesis

At the start of this unit, you wrote a hypothesis about how warmer atmosphere and oceans might change storm behavior.

Take it out now and answer:

1. **How has your thinking changed** since writing that initial hypothesis?
2. What was the **most surprising thing** you learned about storms and climate?
3. What **new questions** do you have that weren't answered in this unit?
4. How confident are you in your argument? What **additional evidence** would make you more confident?
5. What does this mean for **your community**? Should NYC be preparing differently for future storms?

# Unit 5 Summary: What You Figured Out

| Driving Question | What You Figured Out |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| **What causes wind?** | Uneven heating → pressure differences → air flows from H to L pressure |
| **How do blizzards form?** | Mid-latitude cyclones form at cold/warm air mass boundaries; blizzard conditions on cold side |
| **Why do storms follow specific paths?** | Global circulation cells + Coriolis effect create prevailing westerlies that steer storms |
| **What steers storms?** | The jet stream — a high-altitude river of air at cell boundaries |
| **What powers hurricanes?** | Latent heat from condensation of warm ocean water (≥26.5°C) |
| **Why is there a hurricane season?** | Thermal lag: ocean peaks ~2 months after solar maximum |
| **Could storms change in the future?** | Warmer air = more moisture; warmer oceans = more energy; weakened jet = more extremes |

::: {.performance-task}
