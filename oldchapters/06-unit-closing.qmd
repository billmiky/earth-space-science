## Anchor Phenomenon Revisited

Students generate more ideas that explain how solutions to environmental causes of diseases are linked.

### Directions

1. **Revisit** the anchor phenomenon from the Unit Opening.
2. **Reflect** on what you learned about fossil fuels, land use, and mining.
3. **Generate new ideas**: How are the solutions connected?
4. **Create a concept map** showing linkages.

## Performance Task

### How do solutions combine to reduce environmental impacts?

### Directions

1. **Compile solutions** from all three chapters:

| Chapter | Solutions Evaluated |
|---|---|
| Burning Fossil Fuels | Green energy, carbon removal, vehicle emissions |
| Land Use & Biodiversity | Urban greening, green roofs, deforestation |
| Mining | Reclamation, filtration, regulation, transition |

2. **Use a model** to analyze combined impacts

3. **Evaluate and prioritize**: Which solutions should be prioritized? Why?

4. **Write your conclusion** (500-750 words):
   - State recommendations
   - Support with evidence
   - Address driving questions
   - Discuss feasibility

::: {.callout-important title="Performance Task Rubric"}
Evaluated on:
- Accuracy of solution analysis
- Evidence-based reasoning
- Completeness (all three areas)
- Quality of argument
- Real-world constraints

## Unit Reflection

### Directions

**Knowledge Growth**
- What did you know at the beginning?
- What do you know now?
- What was most surprising?

**Skills Development**
- How did you use data analysis?
- How did you evaluate solutions?
- How did models help?

**Real-World Application**
- What actions could you take?
- How can you evaluate environmental claims?
- What roles should different groups play?

## Revisit Your Initial Model

1. **Retrieve** your initial model
2. **Revise** based on learning
3. **Compare** initial and revised
4. **Write a reflection** (200-300 words)

::: {.callout-tip title="Final Thought"}
The problems are complex and interconnected, but so are the solutions. Understanding these connections is the first step toward creating meaningful change.
