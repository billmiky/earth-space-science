# 🌋 Unit 3: Earthquakes, Volcanoes & Tsunamis
**Why do earthquakes, volcanoes, and tsunamis occur where they do — and can we predict them?**
:::

## Anchor Phenomenon

> **On August 27, 1883, the volcanic island of Krakatoa in Indonesia exploded with the force of 10,000 atomic bombs.** The sound was heard 4,800 km away in Australia. The eruption triggered tsunamis up to 30 meters high that killed over 36,000 people. Ash circled the globe, lowering world temperatures for years.
>
> Why do massive volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis happen? Why do they occur in certain places but not others? And is there anything we can do to protect ourselves?

## Driving Question

**Why do earthquakes, volcanoes, and tsunamis occur where they do — and how can humans prepare for and minimize the damage from these natural hazards?**

## Performance Expectations

<span class="pe-badge">HS-ESS1-5</span> <span class="pe-badge">HS-ESS2-1</span> <span class="pe-badge">HS-ESS2-3</span> <span class="pe-badge">HS-ESS3-1</span>

| Standard | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **HS-ESS1-5** | Evaluate evidence of the past and current movements of continental and oceanic crust |
| **HS-ESS2-1** | Develop a model to illustrate how Earth's internal and surface processes operate at different spatial and temporal scales to form features and features |
| **HS-ESS2-3** | Develop a model based on evidence of Earth's interior to describe cycling of matter by convection |
| **HS-ESS3-1** | Construct an explanation based on evidence for how natural hazards have shaped the development of human civilizations |

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:

::: {.key-idea}
1. **Explain** how we know about Earth's interior structure using seismic wave evidence
2. **Describe** how density differences created Earth's layered structure
3. **Identify** plate boundary types and explain the geological features at each
4. **Model** how convection in the mantle drives plate tectonics
5. **Evaluate** evidence for continental drift and seafloor spreading
6. **Construct** explanations for why natural hazards occur where they do
7. **Develop** a risk assessment and mitigation plan for a real location
8. **Argue** whether a location's natural hazard risk outweighs its resource benefits
