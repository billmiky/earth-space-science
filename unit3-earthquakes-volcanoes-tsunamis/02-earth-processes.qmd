# Earth's Surface Processes

## Essential Question

> How do internal and surface processes work together to shape Earth's landscapes?

## Tectonic Plate Motion and Earthquake Activity

Earth's internal processes drive plate tectonics, which shape our planet's surface. This interactive map shows real-time tectonic plate motion and recent earthquake activity, demonstrating how internal forces continuously reshape Earth's surface.

### 🌍 Tectonic Activity Analysis
1. Where do you observe the most earthquake activity on the map?
2. How does the pattern of earthquakes relate to plate boundaries?
3. What surface processes and landforms result from the tectonic plate movements you're seeing?
4. Can you identify any major fault zones or subduction zones based on earthquake clusters?
